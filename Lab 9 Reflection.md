Lab 9 Reflection
What roles does a database have in web apps?
    Databases are responsible for both storing and organizing information that the app uses to function and project. Databases are also responsible for being a central location for all the data in the web app. Databases can also be easily updated, which makes them adaptable.

Why do we need to use SQL language?
    SQLite database makes it easier to make tables, store data, and make a file with all the information in your database. One of the main attributes that make sqlite3 a useful tool for python programs is that it enables multiple database files to connect to one single database. Use of sqlite3 teaches us how to navigate databases and organize user input.
